# Explore This Website
The repository for the Explore This Website Project

Explore This Website is part open source website, part art project, and part social experiment. Created by Aidan "Lumen" Moran, Explore This Site is inspired by early bulletin boards and Multi User Dungeons (MUDs), specifically LambdaMOO, where players could enter the same text based world and alter it to their will, adding rooms, items, and NPCs. ETW hopes to recreate the creativity of MOOs and MUDs by utilizing modern website tech, open source ideas, and the *relative* ease of editing HTML.

To contribute to Explore This Website, submit a pull request with your code. If you just want to explore, hit 'go back' and get exploring!

The point of Explore This Website is to be both playground and safari, giving users, developers, and artists a place to call home. To make sure everything goes smoothly, there's a few rules.

THE RULES

1 - Contributions should be mainly HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. This is partly for easy of readability, and partly to make sure everything runs smoothly.

2 - No overwriting someone elses work. The goal is to add, not subtract.

3 - When submitting a pull request, try to keep it to one major change per request to help out those of us on the back end.

4 - The general 'don't be a dick' rule of the internet applies. We're all friends here. Nothing hateful, threatening, graphic, any of the -ists or -phobics. Be nice.

5 - If there is a valid reason your addition didn't get accepted, refactor and try again! We truly want your ideas, we just want to make sure everything is done right!

6 - Don't spam the submissions! Feel free to add as much as you want and submit as many requests as you feel necessary, but don't overdo it!

7 - PNG, GIF, SVG, and JPEG graphics are welcome, as well as alternate fonts, and JS libraries. Just don't flood the place with them.

8 - Outside links are allowed, but should be kept to a minimum (things like informative links to wikis and the like are acceptable, stuff like that). The project should mostly stay here.

9 - Try to keep code organized and follow established organization patters. i.e. JS libraries should be kept in the JS libraries folder.

10 - No self promotion. This is an art project, not a billboard. Something like signing a big piece of work with your name and a link or leaving a name and link in a comment in the code is more than fine, but don't just throw your blog link on and walk away.

11 - If you use any JS libraries, make sure they are compatible with our repo's license. Or link to them externally, as long as they won't break.

12 - And on that note, try not to do thinks that will break! Either code wise or broken links if something gets changed.

13 - Don't alter the administrative pages like this one or the about tab. We sort of need those.
