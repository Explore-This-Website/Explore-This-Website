    <a href="https://github.com/Explore-This-Website/Explore-This-Website">Click here to visit the Explore This Webiste GitHub repository and organization.</a>
    <br>
    <p>To contribute to Explore This Website, visit the link above and submit a pull request with your code. If you just want to explore, hit 'go back' and get exploring!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The point of Explore This Website is to be both playground and safari, giving users, developers, and artists a place to call home. To make sure everything goes smoothly, there's a few rules.</p>
    <p><b>THE RULES</b></p>
    <p><b>1</b> - Contributions should be mainly HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. This is partly for easy of readability, and partly to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
    <p><b>2</b> - No overwriting someone elses work. The goal is to add, not subtract.</p>
    <p><b>3</b> - When submitting a pull request, try to keep it to one major change per request to help out those of us on the back end.</p>
    <p><b>4</b> - The general 'don't be a dick' rule of the internet applies. We're all friends here. Nothing hateful, threatening, graphic, any of the -ists or -phobics. Be nice.</p>
    <p><b>5</b> - If there is a valid reason your addition didn't get accepted, refactor and try again! We truly want your ideas, we just want to make sure everything is done right!</p>
    <p><b>6</b> - Don't spam the submissions! Feel free to add as much as you want and submit as many requests as you feel necessary, but don't overdo it!</p>
    <p><b>7</b> - PNG, GIF, SVG, and JPEG graphics are welcome, as well as alternate fonts, and JS libraries. Just don't flood the place with them.</p>
    <p><b>8</b> - Outside links are allowed, but should be kept to a minimum (things like informative links to wikis and the like are acceptable, stuff like that). The project should mostly stay here.</p>
    <p><b>9</b> - Try to keep code organized and follow established organization patters. i.e. JS libraries should be kept in the JS libraries folder.</p>
    <p><b>10</b> - No self promotion. This is an art project, not a billboard. Something like signing a big piece of work with your name and a link or leaving a name and link in a comment in the code is more than fine, but don't just throw your blog link on and walk away.</p>
    <p><b>11</b> - If you use any JS libraries, make sure they are compatible with our repo's license. Or link to them externally, as long as they won't break.</p>
    <p><b>12</b> - And on that note, try not to do thinks that will break! Either code wise or broken links if something gets changed.</p>
    <p><b>13</b> - Don't alter the administrative pages like this one or the about tab. We sort of need those.</p>
