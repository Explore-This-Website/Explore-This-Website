    <p>Explore This Website is part open source website, part art project, and part social experiment. Created by Kellen, Explore This Site is inspired by early bulletin boards and Multi User Dungeons (MUDs), specifically LambdaMOO, where players could enter the same text based world and alter it to their will, adding rooms, items, and NPCs. ETW hopes to recreate the creativity of MOOs and MUDs by utilizing modern website tech, open source ideas, and the *relative* ease of editing HTML.
